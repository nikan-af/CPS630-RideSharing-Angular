# CPS630 Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.7.

In order to compile and run the project you need to ensure you have Node and NPM installed.

Follow this link on how to install `https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm`

Download the project using git and go inside the project directory and run `npm install` in the command line to install the dependencies.

After that run `npm start` to compile and start the project.

After that go to localhost:4200 in your browser and you should be able to see the project.

In order to get the backend (PHP part) working you need to install XAMPP.
Here is a link to a tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-CnezwEeo

After running XAMPP make sure you change the PHP port number to 8080.

Then place the api directory located in the project directory inside the htdocs folder in XAMPP.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
